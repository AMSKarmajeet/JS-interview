// Tagname:- arrays functional_programming
// Question
/* According to the lodash documentaion, This method is like _.difference except it
accepts a comparator which is invoked to compare
elements of the array to values.
The order and references of result values are determined by the first array. The comparator
is involked with two arguments: (arrVal, othVal).

This challange requires you to write your own version of this function without
using lodash so that you can better understand it works.
*/
// Solution
var test = require('../test/test.js');

function differneceWith(array, ...values) {


}
